# mftentryparser

This script parses ntfs mft entries from partitions on a device or raw image.
Devices and partitions only works, using linux.

Remark

This script was an assessment during my second semester in IT security master degree program. I know some errors but most time it works fine. 
So, I can't get some warranty about the results!

Use it, try it, modify it as you want. 
If you modify or use my code, it would be nice to know.
